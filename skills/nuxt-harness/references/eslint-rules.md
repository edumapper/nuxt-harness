# ESLint rules — `@edumapper/nuxt-harness/eslint`

Source of truth: [`src/eslint.js`](../../../src/eslint.js). This page explains why each rule exists.
All rules are `error` unless noted. Messages follow ❌ what → 💡 why → 🛠 fix → 📖 doc.

Globs below use the Nuxt 4 layout. Every rule also applies inside Nuxt layers
(`layers/<name>/app/…`), and follows `srcDir: '.'` for apps that kept the Nuxt 3 layout.
Options are described in [configuration.md](configuration.md).

## Entry points

| Export | Used by | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `harness(options?)` | the app's `eslint.config.mjs`, spread into `withNuxt(...)` | every rule below except the type-aware ones. It does not redefine the `vue`/`@typescript-eslint` plugins that Nuxt registers. |
| `typeAware(rootDir, options?)` | the app's `eslint.config.mjs` (full gate) | rules that need the TypeScript program (`projectService`). They need `.nuxt/` to be meaningful. |
| `standalone(options?)` | `nuxt-harness fast` | parsers and plugins from the package's own dependencies, plus `harness()`. No `.nuxt/`, no app install. |

## Architecture: the 5-layer model

| Rule | Files | Forbids |
|---|---|---|
| `arch/no-presenter-in-page` (R0) <a id="no-presenter-in-page"></a> | `app/pages/**/*.vue` | rendering anything but Orchestrators/Operators, HTML, Vue/Nuxt built-ins (`Nuxt*`) and Nuxt UI atoms (`U*`). Directory-prefixed (`<ShopOrcCart>`), lazy (`<LazyOrcCart>`) and kebab-case names are recognized. |
| `arch/no-smart-calls` (R1/R2) <a id="no-smart-calls"></a> | Presenters | stores (`use*Store`), `useRouter`/`useRoute`/`navigateTo`, `useFetch`/`useAsyncData`/`$fetch`, query primitives (`useQuery`, `useMutation`, …) and the app's `dataComposables` |
| `arch/no-data-calls-in-operator` (R3) <a id="no-data-calls-in-operator"></a> | `Op*.vue` | raw data primitives (`$fetch`, `useFetch`, `useAsyncData`, `useQuery`, …). Call a composable. |
| `arch/no-reverse-layer` (R4) | components | upward imports: Presenter → Op/Orc, Op → Orc |
| `arch/no-server-ui-import` | `server/**` | importing Vue components or pages |

Template rules must use `context.sourceCode.parserServices.defineTemplateBodyVisitor`. A top-level
`VElement`/`VAttribute` visitor is never called; `test/rules.test.ts` guards every template rule
with an invalid case.

## Locality

| Rule | Files | Forbids |
|---|---|---|
| `@typescript-eslint/no-restricted-imports` | `app/**` | `~~/server/**` (type imports allowed; exceptions via `allowServerImportsInApp`). Share schemas and types through `shared/`. |
| | `server/**` | `~/**`, `~~/app/**`, `#app`, `#components` |
| | `shared/**` | app and server code: `shared/` stays isomorphic |
| | all | event buses: `mitt`, `tiny-emitter`, `eventemitter3`, `events` |
| `no-restricted-syntax` (only with i18n) | `app/**` | `navigateTo('/…')` / `` navigateTo(`/…`) ``. Use `localePath({ name })`. |
| `arch/no-provide-inject` <a id="no-provide-inject"></a> | `app/**` | Vue `provide()`/`inject()`/`vueApp.provide`. Pass props down or share a composable. Nuxt plugin `provide` stays allowed. |
| `arch/no-auth-gate-outside-middleware` <a id="no-auth-gate-outside-middleware"></a> | components, pages, layouts | a branch that reads an auth composable (`authComposables`, default `useUserSession`, `useAuth`, `useSupabaseUser`, `useSupabaseSession`) and redirects. Access policy lives in route middleware. Displaying the user is fine. |
| `arch/no-bare-navigate` | `app/**` | `navigateTo()` that is not awaited or returned, unless a comment on the line above (or at the end of the line) explains why; `router.push/replace/go` |

## Structural invariants & illegal states

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` | `any` switches the compiler off for everything it touches |
| `vue/define-props-declaration: type-based`, `vue/define-emits-declaration: type-based` | runtime declarations lose literal and union types |
| `vue/require-typed-ref` | `ref()` without a value or type parameter is `Ref<any>` |
| `vue/no-setup-props-reactivity-loss` | destructuring `props` at setup root freezes the value |
| `arch/max-boolean-props` <a id="max-boolean-props"></a> | 3+ boolean props encode 2^N states, most of them illegal. Use one discriminated union prop. |
| `@typescript-eslint/switch-exhaustiveness-check` (type-aware) | adding a union member must break every switch that forgot it |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-condition` (type-aware) | a condition the types prove constant is dead code or a lying type |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-type-assertion` (type-aware) | a cast the types already satisfy hides the real type |
| `@typescript-eslint/no-unsafe-return` (type-aware) | returning `any` leaks it into every caller |

## Guards & reactivity

Principle: use early returns for states that really happen. Don't check states the types or another layer already rule out.

| # | Rule | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | No checks for impossible states (`?.`, `??`, `if (!x)` on a non-nullable). If the type is wrong, fix the type. | `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-condition`, `no-unnecessary-type-assertion` (type-aware) |
| G2 | A guard with more than 2 operands goes into a named `computed` or function, ideally one returning the blocking reason. | `arch/max-condition-operands` <a id="max-condition-operands"></a> (counts every `&&`/`\|\|` leaf, including right-nested `a \|\| (b && c)`; `??` is not counted) |
| G3 | Exit early. No `else` after a return, no deep nesting. | `no-else-return` (`allowElseIf: false`), `max-depth: 2` |
| G4 | Gates live with their owner: auth checks and redirects go in route middleware. | `arch/no-auth-gate-outside-middleware` |
| G5 | A `v-if`/`v-else-if`/`v-show` with more than 2 operands becomes a computed. | `arch/max-condition-operands` |
| G6 | Async handlers set the lock before the first `await`. | code review, not lintable |
| | No more than 3 watchers per file. Derived state is a `computed`; a reaction to a user action goes in that handler; prop sync uses `defineModel`. | `arch/max-watchers` <a id="max-watchers"></a> |
| | Every `<ClientOnly>` is directly preceded by an HTML comment (4+ words) saying why the subtree can't render on the server. | `arch/client-only-needs-reason` <a id="client-only-needs-reason"></a> |

## Control flow & size

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| `no-unsafe-finally` | `return`/`throw` in `finally` silently discards the in-flight error |
| `no-empty` (incl. catch) | `catch {}` swallows errors |
| `complexity: 20` | the C in CRAP. Above it, split the function. |
| `max-params: 4` | the cheapest SRP smell to detect (off in tests) |
| `arch/no-figma-asset-url` | expiring Figma MCP asset URLs (`figma.com/api/mcp/asset/…`, `localhost:3845/assets/…`) ship as broken images |

## Design system (opt-in)

Off by default — the harness ships no design tokens. Enable with `designSystem` in
[configuration](configuration.md#design-system). Applies to `app/**/*.vue`.

| Rule | Enabled by | Forbids |
|---|---|---|
| `arch/no-hardcoded-color` | `designSystem` (unless `hardcodedColors: false`) | hex/rgb/hsl in `class`, `style` or string literals. Use token classes or `var(--color-*)`. |
| `arch/no-off-palette-color-class` <a id="no-off-palette-color-class"></a> | `designSystem.palettes` | Tailwind built-in palettes (`gray`, `sky`, …) not listed in `palettes`. Custom palettes are never flagged. |
| `arch/no-nested-border-box` (warn) | `designSystem` (unless `nestedBorderBox: false`) | bordered, rounded boxes inside other bordered surfaces (`surfaceComponents`, default Nuxt UI cards and overlays) |

## Static checks (not ESLint)

Plain file scans in [`src/checks.js`](../../../src/checks.js), run by both gates:

| Check | Reports |
|---|---|
| Import hygiene | `../../` deep relative imports, `./index` barrel imports |
| Escape hatches | `@ts-ignore`/`@ts-nocheck`/`@ts-expect-error`; blanket `eslint-disable`; any disable of a harness rule; other disables without `-- reason` |
| Console hygiene | `console.log/debug/info` outside tests (`warn`/`error` allowed) |
| Secret scan | Stripe keys, hardcoded passwords/API keys/tokens, long base64 literals |
| Unvalidated `readBody` | `readBody()` in `server/` whose result isn't `.parse()`d within 3 lines. Prefer `readValidatedBody`. |
| i18n keys | static `t('a.b')` keys missing from any JSON file in `i18n/locales/` (or `locales/`) |
| TODO markers | `TODO`/`FIXME`/`HACK` (warning) |

## Considered and not adopted (yet)

- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`: valuable, but produces many type errors on existing apps, and TS errors can't be bulk-suppressed. Worth enabling on a new app.
- `strict-boolean-expressions`: mostly style noise. `no-unsafe-assignment/call/member-access`: noisy on auto-imports when types can't be resolved.
- dependency-cruiser: Nuxt auto-imports components and composables, so the import graph it sees is incomplete. The layer and locality rules above cover the edges that exist as imports.
